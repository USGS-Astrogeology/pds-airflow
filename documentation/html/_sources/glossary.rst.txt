    DAG
        DAGs, in the context of this project, refer to the concept developed by
        Airflow and utilized in its scheduling solution. For the purposes of
        this project, individuals DAGs represent individual pipeline jobs.

        In Airflow, a DAG – or a Directed Acyclic Graph – is a collection of all
        the tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their
        relationships and dependencies.

        For example, a simple DAG could consist of three tasks: A,
        B, and C. It could say that A has to run successfully before B can run,
        but C can run anytime. It could say that task A times out after 5
        minutes, and B can be restarted up to 5 times in case it fails. It might
        also say that the workflow will run every night at 10pm, but shouldn’t
        start until a certain date.

        DAGs are represented as executable Python code, with specific tasks in a
        pipeline job being represented by objects within that code.
